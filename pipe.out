"AH! yes, i see. but you see, sir, them's not our geese."
"AH, yes, i shall keep the stone. thank you. and, i say, peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."
"AND you can do nothing until then?"
"BECAUSE we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise." "we have retained these things for some days," said holmes,
"BRECKINRIDGE is his name."
"BUT beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. no, sir, i think that, with your permission, i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard." the man burst into a hearty laugh. "they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he,
"BY all means."
"BY the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown goose." "there is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he.
"CERTAINLY, sir," said baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn, near the museum--we are to be found in the museum itself during the day, you understand. this year our good host, windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at christmas. my pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. i am much indebted to you, sir, for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.
"DO you think that this man horner is innocent?"
"GIVE me a pencil and that slip of paper. now, then: 'found at the corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat. mr. henry baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221b, baker street.' that is clear and concise."
"I cannot tell."
"I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them." our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked.
"IN that case i shall continue my professional round. but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
"IN which, sir?"
"INDEED! whose, then?"
"INDEED? i know some of them. which was it?"
"IT is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. are you hungry, watson?" "so much for mr. henry baker," said holmes when he had closed the door behind him.
"IT is, i think, much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. that, however, i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."
"IT'S a bonny thing," said he. "just see how it glints and sparkles. of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. every good stone is. they are the devil's pet baits. in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. this stone is not yet twenty years old. it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. in spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. there have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? i'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it." when the commissionaire had gone, holmes took up the stone and held it against the light.

"it's a bonny thing," said he.
"MR. henry baker, i believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "pray take this chair by the fire, mr. baker. it is a cold night, and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. ah, watson, you have just come at the right time. is that your hat, mr. baker?"
"MY geese!" the man seemed surprised.
"NOT particularly."
"NOTHING."
"OF course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"
"OH, certainly, certainly," answered mr. baker with a sigh of relief.
"OH, in the globe, star, pall mall, st. james's, evening news, standard, echo, and any others that occur to you."
"PRAY take this chair by the fire, mr. baker. it is a cold night, and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. ah, watson, you have just come at the right time. is that your hat, mr. baker?"

"SO much for mr. henry baker," said holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. are you hungry, watson?"
"THEN i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."
"THERE are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn, near the museum--we are to be found in the museum itself during the day, you understand. this year our good host, windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at christmas. my pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. i am much indebted to you, sir, for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way. "certainly, sir," said baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm.
"THERE is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "by the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown goose."
"THEY might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. no, sir, i think that, with your permission, i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard." the man burst into a hearty laugh.
"TO eat it!" our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
"VERY glad to see you. i dine at seven. there is a woodcock, i believe. by the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps i ought to ask mrs. hudson to examine its crop."
"VERY naturally. by the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."
"VERY well, sir. and this stone?"
"VERY. but will he see it?"
"WE have retained these things for some days," said holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
"WELL, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. here you are, peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers."
"WELL, i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden."
"WELL, then, do you imagine that this other one, henry baker, had anything to do with the matter?"
"WHAT will you say?"
"YES, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"
"YES, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
"YES. i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr. henry baker, who was a member of your goose club."
"YOUR beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.
